      "title": "What is a Gantt Chart?",
      "p1": "A Gantt chart is a project management tool that displays project schedules in a bar chart format. Invented by Henry Gantt in the 1910s, it remains one of the most popular project management visualization tools today.",
      "p2": "In Ganttleman's Resource Gantt Chart, we apply the traditional Gantt chart concept to team resource allocation. Each Member corresponds to a row, different time periods (Sprints) correspond to columns, and Task cards are placed at the intersection of members and sprints.",
      "p3": "This visualization allows you to see at a glance: which members are responsible for which tasks during what time period, whether the team's workload is balanced, and whether there are resource conflicts."

      "title": "Gantt Chart Related",
      "q1": {
        "question": "How do I backup my Gantt chart data?",
        "answer": "Click the 'Export JSON' button in the toolbar to export the entire project as a JSON file. We recommend regular backups in case browser data is cleared."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Can I sync data between different computers?",
        "answer": "Since data is stored locally in the browser, automatic syncing is not available. However, you can use 'Export JSON' and 'Import JSON' functions to manually transfer data between different computers."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How do I share the Gantt chart with my team?",
        "answer": "You can use 'Export PNG' or 'Export PDF' functions to export the Gantt chart as an image or PDF file, then share it with team members via email, Slack, or other methods. The PDF format also supports clickable hyperlinks."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What are task card links for?",
        "answer": "You can set hyperlinks for tasks to link to related documents, Jira tickets, GitHub issues, or other references. Use Cmd/Ctrl + Click to quickly open links. When exported as PDF, these links are preserved and clickable."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What if I accidentally delete data?",
        "answer": "You can use Cmd+Z (Mac) or Ctrl+Z (Windows) to undo operations. Ganttleman supports multi-step Undo/Redo functionality. If you've already closed the page, you'll need to restore from a previously exported JSON backup."

    "technical": {
      "title": "Technical Questions",
      "q1": {
        "question": "Why did my Gantt chart disappear after clearing browser data?",
        "answer": "Gantt chart data is stored in the browser's LocalStorage. If you clear browser data (including site data, cookies, etc.), the Gantt chart data will also be deleted. This is why we recommend regularly exporting JSON backups."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Can I use it on mobile?",
        "answer": "Yes, but the Gantt chart tool works better on computers. Mobile screens are smaller and dragging operations are less convenient. Other tools like JSON formatter, Base64 encoder, etc. work perfectly fine on mobile."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What if I encounter problems or bugs?",
        "answer": "If you encounter any issues or find bugs, please contact us through the contact information in the footer. We will address and fix issues as soon as possible."

      "title": "Other Tools",
      "q1": {
        "question": "Does the JSON formatter validate syntax?",
        "answer": "Yes, when you click the 'Parse and Edit' button, the tool automatically validates JSON syntax. If there are errors, it will display error messages and error locations."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Does image compression reduce quality?",
        "answer": "There will be some quality loss, but it's usually imperceptible to the naked eye. You can adjust the compression quality slider to control the compression level. We recommend setting it between 70-85% for a good balance between file size and quality."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Is the encryption tool secure?",
        "answer": "All encryption operations are performed locally in your browser, and keys and data are not uploaded to servers. However, you must keep your keys safe, as data cannot be decrypted without them. This tool is suitable for general purposes; for extremely sensitive data, we recommend using professional encryption software."
